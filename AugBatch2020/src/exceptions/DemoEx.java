 * exception  and error are different.
 * 
 * Exceptions are recoverable
 * 
 * Errors are not recoverable e.g outOfMemory
 * they are caused due to lack of system resources
 * not by our program.
 * 
 * 
 * Exception Handling:
 * 1. By using try catch
 * 
 * try catch are two keywords.
 * 
 * syntax:
 * 
 *   try{
 *       //risky code
 *   }
 *  
 *   catch(Exception exceptionObject)
 *   {
 *     //handling code
 *   }
 *   
 * 
 * Write the risky code in the try block
 * &
 * corresponding handling code inside the catch block.
